I've been using Barker! which is a platform on Bugbountyhunter.com for over a week since writting this, I was worried at first thinking I was way outta my depth and I wouldnt have 
a clue what I was looking for but as previsouly mentioned I have @Zseano's methodology and it has been working, I also have access to his Discord server where, if stuck of you are struggling with a bug, you can find help in there - I've not seen anyone directy say (Do this) which is great bevause we dont want complete walkthrough's else your just copying someone elses work. Im not shy of a walkthrough, I do use then and especially in the early days - trying to decode what on earth was on my screen was terrible but i've since been able to complete certain tasks on my own and without the need for a walkthrough.
